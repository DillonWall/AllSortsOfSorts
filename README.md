# AllSortsOfSorts

## Overview
This program is an implementation of a multitude of sorting algorithms including: Brute Force Bubble, Flagged Bubble, Selection, 
Insertion, Shell, Heap, Merge (recursive), and Quick (recursive)

Coded in native C++, and implemented on C Arrays, Vectors, and my own templated Array.

## Details
This program will ask the user for how many elements they
would like to sort through. It will then go through the
following sorts for each C Arrays, Vectors, and my 
Templated Array: Brute Force Bubble, Flagged Bubble, Selection, 
Insertion, Shell, Heap, Merge (recursive), and Quick (recursive).

The times taken in ms for each sort are output to the console and 
the file "sort_results.txt" as well as every 1000th element
is output to the file to check if successful.

### Input
In the initial menu, the user must enter some integer of
how much data elements they would like the sorts to use.
Also, the program accepts an integer from the console
of how many data elements to use.

### Output
The program will output the container type, name, and time it took for
each sort, and also output the same to a file as well as
every 1000th element in the sorted array to easily check if
it was successful.

## Installation
Open and run with Visual Studio 2022 (or your IDE of choice)

## Status
This project is finished
